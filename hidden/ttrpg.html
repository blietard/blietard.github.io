                    <h4 class="mb-4"> If you know what is a Tabletop Roleplay Game, you can skip this section. </h4>
                    <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between mb-5">

                            <div> A <b>Tabletop Roleplay Game</b> (TTRPG) is an asymetrical game in which basically one person (the <b>Game Master</b>) narrates a story. The other players (simply called <b>Players</b>) incarnate the main characters.</div>
                            <div> TTRPG is about sitting around a table and playing with imagination, roleplay, discussion, dice rolls and most importantly : fun (as many other genres of games, yes). </div>
                            <div> In a TTRPG, the Game Master not only <b>narrates</b> a story but they also <b>invites the Players to take part</b> in that story. Usually, the GM <b>describes a delicate situation</b> that the main characters have to face, and invites the Players to declare <b>how their character should act</b> in this situation.</div>
                            <div> Each Player has a <b>character of their own</b> with features distinct from other characters of the story. This can be outstanding physical abilities, brilliant or brainless mind, magical powers, etc. depending the type of story that is narrated. Players' characters are not the only ones of the story. The Game Master will roleplay <b>Non-Playable Characters</b> (NPCs) players can interact with.</div>
                            <div> Moreover, characters are not a 1-to-1 reflect of their players and the story isn't really happening. The Game Master will sometimes ask a player to <b>roll dice</b> to <b>check</b> if the character can perform a desired action.</div>
                        </div>
